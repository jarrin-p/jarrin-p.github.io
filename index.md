# Hey friends. I'm Jarrin.

And welcome to my page. I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics from Salisbury University. I'm a lover of learning new things and toying with new gadgets.

## A few presentations I've done

[Improving Optimization with Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms](https://www.salisbury.edu/explore-academics/research/summer-research.aspx#ImprovingOptimization-22)

[Case Study Comparison of Stochastic SIR models vs. Deterministic SIR models](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Mathfest-program18.pdf#page=64)
