# Hey friends. I'm Jarrin.

And welcome to my page. I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics from Salisbury University where I researched mathematical models related to nuclear physics. I'm a lover of learning new things and toying with new gadgets, and I started hobby programming in early high school. Since then my passion for math and computer science has only continued to grow.

## A quick overview
