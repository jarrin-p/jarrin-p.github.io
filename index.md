# A little about me

Passionate learner who really enjoys functional programming, math and general computer science. Currently a masters student at the University of Illinois Springfield, and working as a research assistant on proving theorems about Chemical Reaction Networks using `Lean4`.

## A few presentations from the past that I've done

[Improving Optimization with Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms](https://www.salisbury.edu/explore-academics/research/summer-research.aspx#ImprovingOptimization-32#:~:text=jarrin,peters)

[Case Study Comparison of Stochastic SIR models vs. Deterministic SIR models](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Mathfest-program18.pdf#page=64)
